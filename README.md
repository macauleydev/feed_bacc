           ***************************

             One player MAKES a CODE
           as a sequence of 4 letters,
           each from the set, ABCDEF.

        The other player BREAKS the CODE
           in a maximum of 12 guesses.

      Each guess generates feedback such as

           *o..        or         **oo

                 which tallies:

           *  (correctly-placed letters)
           o  (out-of-place letters)
           .  (superfluous letters)
